 * `?breakdown=1` adds the per-surface aggregate. Opt-in so the public component
 * cannot start emitting operational detail by accident.
 *
 * **No rate is computed from these counts, deliberately.** `delivered` and
 * `analysed` are separate volumes written on different code paths under
 * independent rate-limit budgets — `delivered` exceeding `analysed` is normal,
 * and `web` never writes `analysed` at all. See `getCheckEvents` in
